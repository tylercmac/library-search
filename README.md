## Description

This application returns results from the Library of Congress API based on user-entered parameters.

redirects the user to a page that lists the results of the search. Search results are displayed in cards that
list the title, date, tagged subject(s), a brief description, and a link to the result at loc.gov.
The user can perform another search, if desired.
